# PythonHTTPHandler
Http post handler with JWT security

Description: its a multithread HTTP server wich handles the POST requests and GET requests. /status indicates the requests handled and the start time. /post handles the requests. Each HTTP request is served by a sepparate server thread.
The POST messages received are added to a queue array.
A queue processor thread processes each message in order: adds de JWT and post each message to the destination address.
For simplicityÂ´s sake , I have only included Content-Type = multipart/form-data. You should post a request like form-data, create a key called message with any value. The value is the message payload. (see post request sample screenshot for Postman GUI)
